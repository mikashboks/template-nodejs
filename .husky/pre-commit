# Run lint-staged on staged files (much faster)
npx lint-staged

# Decide on testing strategy:
# Option A: Keep running all tests (safest, potentially slow)
npm run test

# Option B: Run only related tests (faster, needs setup/config)
# npm run test --related # Check Vitest docs for 'related' functionality

# Option C: Skip tests here, rely on CI (fastest pre-commit, relies on CI discipline)
# (Remove npm run test line)
