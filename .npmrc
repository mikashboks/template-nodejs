# Specify package-lock usage (default behavior in modern npm, but explicit)
package-lock=true

# Configure npm to use GitHub Packages registry for packages under the @mikashboks scope
# This means 'npm install @mikashboks/some-package' will fetch from GitHub Packages.
# Other packages (like 'express') will still use the default npmjs.org registry.
@mikashboks:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/

# --- Authentication Note ---
# To install private packages from @mikashboks on GitHub Packages, or to publish
# packages under this scope, you need to authenticate. This is usually done by
# configuring an authToken in your USER-level ~/.npmrc file, NOT typically
# in this project-level .npmrc file.
# Refer to GitHub Packages documentation for authentication details.
# Example entry for ~/.npmrc:
# //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN

# --- Optional Settings ---
# Uncomment the line below to strictly enforce the 'engines' field
# in package.json during installation. Can sometimes cause issues if
# minor node/npm versions don't match exactly.
# engine-strict=true
